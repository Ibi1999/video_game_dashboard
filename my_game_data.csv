For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand.<br><br><i>Firefight</i> --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.<br><br><i>Skirmish</i> --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.<br><br><i>Occupy</i> --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or &quot;tug of war&quot;.<br><br><i>Ambush</i> --- A high value target (&quot;HVT&quot;) must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate.<br><br><i>Strike</i> --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry.<br><br><i>Infiltrate</i> --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy.<br><br><i>Flashpoint</i> --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective.<br><br><i>Elimination</i> --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Cooperative Game Modes</h2><br><i>Checkpoint</i> --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy.

High on tension, with only one-life.<br><br><i>Survival</i> --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps.

God's Trigger,,PEGI 16,,"""God’s Trigger is a fast paced, top-down, 3D action slasher where you, as a former army veteran and now a priest, begin your crusade against the evil of our times - gangs, drugs, human trafficking. You’re filled with God’s will to purify the world from its depravity. You are the hand of God and there will be no mercy for sinners!
<br>
<br>The main and most unique gameplay mechanics in God’s Trigger is called Divine Focus and gives the player the ability to avoid bullets and tactically plan his attacks. The time is running normally for as long as the player keeps moving. As soon as Zoran stops though, the time slows down too. This allows the player to actually see bullets coming his way and in result avoid them. Even though the player can activate and deactivate Divine Focus whenever he wants, the ability has its limits. To refill its resource, the player needs to kill at least one enemy, without Divine Focus being activated.
<br>
<br>Another feature important for how the gameplay evolves is a One Mistake rule which is really simple in its assumptions. Each hit is fatal for the main protagonist and means the game is over for the player.
<br>
<br>The main reason behind introducing those two mechanics to the game, was to give players the opportunity to experience the joy of a pure, hardcore gameplay, with no place for mistakes. But in the same time, to give them a lot of freedom in clearing up the level and deciding how their play through will look like.""",One More Level,Techland Publishing,FALSE,FALSE,"Co-Operative, Multiplayer, Single Player",9bc4423d873845739cc99ab69b6bfbe9,"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Indie, Puzzle, Shooter",,18/04/2019,17/06/2025 23:53,,17/06/2025 23:57,17/06/2025 23:53,PC (Windows),0,0,Epic,,,63,90,,927db97d-cb73-434a-91ed-5061f4f5f218

He suspects his mission is a hoax until a mysterious young woman saves him from a strange and deadly phenomenon... Lifeless Planet is a third-person action-adventure that features an old-school sci-fi story and spectacular environments in the spirit of classic action-adventures.
